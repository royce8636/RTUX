## Logs
This is where all logs from the UXB will be stored. The logs will be created with default name of current date, and inside will be folders with numbers that represent each iteration. 

The all_log folder contains all the detected logs, and inside it is all_frames folder where all the frames taken during the test will be saved to (only if -a flag is given during the test).
